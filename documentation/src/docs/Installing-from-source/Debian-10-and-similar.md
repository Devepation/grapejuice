## Preamble

‚ùì If you didn't click on the guide for Debian, but ended up on this page regardless, please do not panic! Debian is a distribution that is the base for many other distributions in the Linux landscape. This guide is applicable to the following distributions:
- Debian 10 (buster)
- Debian 11 (bullseye)
- Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo)
- Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa)
- Ubuntu 19.10 (Eoan Ermine)
- LMDE 4 (Debbie)
- Linux Mint 20 (Ulyana)
- Zorin OS 16

---

‚ùó This guide assumes that you've properly set up `sudo` on your Debian system and that dbus is properly configured. If you are using a display manager like `lightdm` or are using a desktop environment provided by the distributor, dbus should be in place properly.

Don't know what any of that means? If you've installed Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or selected a desktop environment in the Debian installer, don't worry about this.

---

üíª All commands in this guide should be run in a terminal emulator using a regular user account that has access to `su` or `sudo`. If you are running a fully fledged desktop environment, you can find a  terminal emulator in your applications menu.

## 1. Install Wine
Roblox on Linux requires rather recent versions of Wine. For that reason it's recommended that you use the [official WineHQ repositories](https://wiki.winehq.org/Download) and install either `winehq-devel` or `winehq-staging`. Make sure `wine --version` reports a version that is at least `6.11`

Note for users of distributions that are Ubuntu derivatives: You need to select an Ubuntu repository that aligns with your specific derivative. The Ubuntu codename for your specific distribution can be found in the file `/etc/os-release` as the value `UBUNTU_CODENAME`

## 2. Synchronise the package repositories
We have to make sure that all repositories and locally installed packages are up to date. Run the following two commands in a terminal:
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## 3. Installing Grapejuice dependencies
Grapejuice requires a set of libraries to be installed and to be run. These dependencies can be installed by running the following command:
```sh
sudo apt install -y git python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-wheel python3-dev pkg-config libcairo2-dev gtk-update-icon-cache desktop-file-utils xdg-utils libgirepository1.0-dev gir1.2-gtk-3.0
```

## 4. Install Grapejuice
First, you have to acquire a copy of the source code. This is easily done by cloning the git repository.
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/brinkervii/grapejuice.git /tmp/grapejuice
```

After the git clone command is finished, Grapejuice can be installed.
```sh
cd /tmp/grapejuice
python3 ./install.py
```

## 5. üöÄ Run Grapejuice for the first time
Running Grapejuice for the first time requires some additional steps. Please follow the [guide on running Grapejuice for the first time](/Guides/First-time-setup)
