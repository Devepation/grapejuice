---
## Preamble

âš  These instructions have only been tested on Fedora Workstation 32!

ðŸ–¥ If you are using the Wayland display server, you might not get any graphical output from Roblox. In that case you
should try running Roblox Studio using an Xorg session.

## Installing Grapejuice dependencies

Grapejuice requires a set of libraries to be installed and to be run. These dependencies can be installed by running the
following command:

```sh
sudo dnf install git python3-devel python3-pip cairo-devel gobject-introspection-devel cairo-gobject-devel dbus-glib-devel make xdg-utils
```

## Installing Grapejuice

First, you have to aquire a copy of the source code. This is easily done by cloning the git repository.

```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://gitlab.com/brinkervii/grapejuice.git
```

After the git clone command is finished, Grapejuice can be installed.

```sh
cd grapejuice
./install.py
```

## Installing a patched Wine build

It's recommended that you install a patched version of Wine. See [this guide](../Guides/Installing-Wine)
for more information.
