## üëã Welcome
Welcome to the Grapejuice wiki. This is the repository where all the documentation for the project is kept.

### ‚ö† Important notices ‚ö†
- Make sure to install Wine!
- Grapejuice is a **management application**! Packages will in most cases not automatically install Wine for you, since package management in some distributions can be extremely odd and limit your choices in custom builds.
- You need to have Wine 6.11 or greater installed in order for Roblox Player to work!

Distributions mark a lot of Wine's dependencies as 'optional', in reality most of them aren't. If you're having issues with Roblox not functioning properly, make sure you have all the required 'optional' dependencies installed. Here's an (older but still relevant) blog post discussing the issue: https://www.gloriouseggroll.tv/how-to-get-out-of-wine-dependency-hell/

### üêû Known Issues
Roblox Player doesn't work perfectly yet. There are some bugs like the mouse getting stuck. Most known issues are documented on the 'Roblox on Linux' fandom page: https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Roblox_on_Linux

## üöÄ Installing Grapejuice
