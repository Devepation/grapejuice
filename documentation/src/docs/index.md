## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Welcome to the Grapejuice wiki. This is the repository where all the documentation for the project is kept.

### âš  Important notices âš 

- Make sure to install Wine!
- Grapejuice is a **management application**! Packages will in most cases not automatically install Wine for you, since
  package management in some distributions can be extremely odd and limit your choices in custom builds.
- You need to have Wine 6.11 or above, or Wine Staging 6.16 or above for the Roblox Player to work!

Distributions mark a lot of Wine's dependencies as 'optional'. In reality, most of them aren't. If you're having issues
with Roblox not functioning properly, make sure you have all the required 'optional' dependencies installed.

## ðŸš€ Installing Grapejuice

Packages are available for some distributions. If a package is available for your distribution,
it's recommended that you use the package rather than installing from source. Otherwise, you'll need to install
